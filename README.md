# My startpages

## What are startpages

Startpages are the home of your browser, they can contain useful information, recently visited websites, time and weather data.

## Where to find my startpages

The code for a startpage can be found under __src/__ of a startpage folder.

## How to use my startpages
First, let's clone the repo (recommended)
```
git clone https://github.com/grtcdr/startpages
```
Set it as a home page for Firefox:
1. Open Firefox and click on the hamburger menu on the top right
2. Click Preferences
3. Click Home
4. Next to "Homepage and new windows" is a drop down list: select **Custom URLs**
5. Paste the URL of startpage_1.html
in my case this is: _file:///home/bata/Startpages/startpage_1/src/startpage.html_

_Beware that icons might not show up if you change the icon names and/or their location without updating the code of the startpage_

__You can find a how-to guide to set the startpage as your new tab page over at https://stpg.tk__
